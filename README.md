Dynamic Array in C - Readme
Overview
This project focuses on implementing a dynamic array in the C programming language. A dynamic array, also known as a dynamic memory array or a resizable array, is an array with a variable size that can be changed during runtime. Unlike static arrays, dynamic arrays do not have a fixed size, allowing for more flexibility in managing memory.

Project Description
In this project, you will learn how to create a dynamic array in C, enabling you to allocate memory dynamically, resize the array as needed, and efficiently manage elements. This implementation provides a hands-on experience in memory management and array manipulation in C.

Key Features
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Learn how to allocate memory dynamically for the array elements using functions like malloc() and free().
Resizable Array: Implement methods to resize the array dynamically when it reaches its capacity.
Element Manipulation: Perform operations like insertion, deletion, updating, and accessing elements in the dynamic array.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms for out-of-bound accesses and memory allocation failures.
Optimized Memory Usage: Understand techniques to optimize memory usage by resizing the array based on the number of elements.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your directory to the project folder:
